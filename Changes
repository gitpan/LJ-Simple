Revision history for Perl extension LJ::Simple.

0.12  Wed Jan  5 23:35:07 GMT 2005
	- Added the $LJ::Simple::NonBlock hook to allow better integration with
		GUI programs
	- Added the $LJ::Simple::ProtoSub hook to allow better integration with
		GUI programs
	- The ljpost example script is now placed within the Solaris package
		the pkg Makefile target builds
	- Corrected a bug in ljpost which caused it to handle timezones
		incorrectly.
	- Added the sending of a User-Agent string
	- GetEntries() has been fixed so that if it is getting entries from a
		 shared journal that shared journal name is placed within the
		 entries returned back in the hash.
		Bug reported by Stanislav Sinyagin
	- Re-worked the documentation so its easier to use
	- Added the SetProtect() routine as a wrapper around the various
		SetProtect*() routines.
	- Added the LJ::Simple::QuickPost() routine which allows you to quickly
		post an entry into LiveJournal without going through the work
		of object creation et al.

0.11  Wednesday April 14 12:19:02 BST 2004
	- Re-added the test.pl after people on the CPAN mailing list complained;
		however the script has been altered so that out of the box it
		hardly touches the functionality of LJ::Simple thanks to the
		removal of the test user on www.livejournal.com. If people
		wish they can place another username and password in the $user
		and $pass variables in test.pl to run all of the test.pl
		Bear in mind that I'm not going to be held responsible for
		what happens to the journal that test.pl is pointed at though.
	- Added the DefaultPicURL() routine to return the URL to the default
		icon for the user who logged in. Functionality added at
		request of Gavin Mogan.
