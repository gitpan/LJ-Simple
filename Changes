Revision history for Perl extension LJ::Simple.

0.14  Wed Oct  5 17:52:45 BST 2005
	- Added ability to cvs tag to Makefile.PL
	- Changed certain uses of gmtime() to localtime() when dealing with
		the retrival of entries and the like so that the expected
		results are found.
	- More sanity checking of the arguments passed to sub-routines
	- Corrected the encoding of values so that the "+" character 
		actually ends up as a "+" and not a space.
	- examples/friends-only: Added some sanity checks to ensure that
		entries which are blank do not get acted on.
	- Fixed SetProtectPublic() so that it actually works; I'm pretty
		sure that this used to work so I'm guessing that the LJ
		flat protocol implementation has changed. Problem noted
		by Igor Guryanov

0.13  Fri Jul  8 10:35:04 BST 2005
	- Documentation fix for GetEntries() to note that it will only every
		return 50 items no matter what mode is used. Added pointer to
		SyncItems(). SyncItems() documentation updated to add a pointer
		to the examples/friends-only script.
	- Correct the version target in Makefile.PL so that the version shown
		in the README file is correctly updated.
	- Added the Setprop_taglist() method to set tags in posts
	- Updated examples/ljpost to include setting of tags
	- Fixed how the SendRequest() handles the response from the server; it
		no longer blindly removes \r from the response. Whilst at the
		moment this is not an issue as the flat protocol is unlikely to
		contain \r, it could be an issue in the future.
	- Fixed the test script test.pl to deal with a failure to create the
		object; correctly handles returning the right number of tests.
		Problem noted by STEPANOV
	- Added support for http_proxy and HTTP_PROXY environment variables
		within the LJ::Simple object creation. The environment
		variables on only looked at iff the http variable is *not*
		given during the object creation.
		Problem noted by STEPANOV

0.12.1  Wed Jan 12 21:13:35 GMT 2005
	- Minor release for a fix to QuickPost() which caused a runtime error
		if a subject was set. The documentation was also corrected to
		show that the entry option is always required.

0.12  Wed Jan  5 23:35:07 GMT 2005
	- Added the $LJ::Simple::NonBlock hook to allow better integration with
		GUI programs
	- Added the $LJ::Simple::ProtoSub hook to allow better integration with
		GUI programs
	- The ljpost example script is now placed within the Solaris package
		the pkg Makefile target builds
	- Corrected a bug in ljpost which caused it to handle timezones
		incorrectly.
	- Added the sending of a User-Agent string
	- GetEntries() has been fixed so that if it is getting entries from a
		 shared journal that shared journal name is placed within the
		 entries returned back in the hash.
		Bug reported by Stanislav Sinyagin
	- Re-worked the documentation so its easier to use
	- Added the SetProtect() routine as a wrapper around the various
		SetProtect*() routines.
	- Added the LJ::Simple::QuickPost() routine which allows you to quickly
		post an entry into LiveJournal without going through the work
		of object creation et al.

0.11  Wednesday April 14 12:19:02 BST 2004
	- Re-added the test.pl after people on the CPAN mailing list complained;
		however the script has been altered so that out of the box it
		hardly touches the functionality of LJ::Simple thanks to the
		removal of the test user on www.livejournal.com. If people
		wish they can place another username and password in the $user
		and $pass variables in test.pl to run all of the test.pl
		Bear in mind that I'm not going to be held responsible for
		what happens to the journal that test.pl is pointed at though.
	- Added the DefaultPicURL() routine to return the URL to the default
		icon for the user who logged in. Functionality added at
		request of Gavin Mogan.

0.10  Saturday March 20 21:28:29 GMT 2004
	- Added the examples directory in the distribution
	- Fixed a bug in how the SendRequest() routine parsed the
		results from the LiveJournal server.
	- Removed the test.pl script from the distribution as LiveJournal
		have removed the test user it depended on
	- Updated the ljpost example with the ability to post restricted posts
	- Corrected the example code for GetFriendGroups() shown on the manual page
